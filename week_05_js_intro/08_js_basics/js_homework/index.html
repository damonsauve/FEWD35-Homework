<h2>Control Flow Exercise: The Marathon Runner</h2>

<ul>
<li>Create a prompt that asks the user what their best marathon time was.</li>
<li>If their time was between 4 to 5 hours, alert the user that their time was average.</li>
<li>if the time was between 2 to 4 hours, alert the user that their time was excellent.</li>
<li>If the time was greater than 5 hours, alert the user that they need to speed up!</li>
</ul>

<h2>In-Class Lab / Homework: Part 1</h2>

<ul>
<li>Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 20. </li>
<li>For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd, and report that to the screen (e.g. "2 is even").</li>
<li>Do this using a <code>FOR</code> loop and then try to replicate the same functionality with a <code>WHILE</code> loop.</li>
<li>You will have to look up the syntax for the while loop, and also the modulus (%) operator.</li>
</ul>

<h2>In-Class Lab / Homework: Part 2</h2>

<ul>
<li>Define a function max() that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Use the if-then-else construct available in Javascript.</li>
<li>Define a function maxOfThree() that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Check out the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math">Math</a> module built in to JavaScript to help you.</li>
</ul>
