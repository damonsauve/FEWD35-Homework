# Project Proposal
For my project, I would like to update the website for the literary magazine that I publish called Oyster Boy Review.

Here is a link to the previous issue:

http://www.oysterboyreview.org/issue/21/

The print version of issue 22 just came out this month, but I have not published the online version, which is generated using a Perl-based static-site generator that I wrote a decade ago, which uses HTML templates that rely on tables.

For this project, I would like to rewrite the HTML templates using CSS and Bootstrap. The new design should be mobile and screen-size responsive.

The page types to be redesigned include:

- cover (http://www.oysterboyreview.org/issue/21/)
- content list (http://www.oysterboyreview.org/issue/21/art/index-art.html)
- single content (http://www.oysterboyreview.org/issue/21/reviews/CarsonR-Floyd-Miller.html)
- art section with pop-up (http://www.oysterboyreview.org/issue/21/art/index-art.html)

Bringing the online version of my magazine into the 21st century will bring much needed credibility to the website, and will please both reader and contributor.
