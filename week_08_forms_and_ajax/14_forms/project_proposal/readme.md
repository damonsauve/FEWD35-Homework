# Project Proposal
For my project, I would like to update the website for the literary magazine that I publish called Oyster Boy Review.

Here is a link to the previous issue:

http://www.oysterboyreview.org/issue/21/

The print version of issue 22 was published in October, but I have not published the online version, which is generated using a Perl-based, static-site generator that I wrote a decade ago, which uses HTML templates that rely on tables for page structure and design.

For this project, I would like to rewrite the HTML templates using CSS and Bootstrap. The new design should be mobile and screen-size responsive.

The page types to be redesigned include:

- cover (http://www.oysterboyreview.org/issue/21/)
- content list (http://www.oysterboyreview.org/issue/21/art/index-art.html)
- single content (http://www.oysterboyreview.org/issue/21/reviews/CarsonR-Floyd-Miller.html)
- art section with pop-up (http://www.oysterboyreview.org/issue/21/art/index-art.html)

Pages are composed of six template files:

- meta.html
- header.html
- subheader.html
- body.html
- subfooter.html
- footer.html

I have included the current template files in this repo.

Bringing the online version of my magazine into the 21st century will bring much needed readability to the website, pleasing both reader and contributor.
